That dress would look even better accelerating towards my bedroom floor at 9.8 meters per second squared.
Any woman who has ever been with me knows that The Big Bang is not just a theory.
What do you say we use my lever to shift your center of mass?
Does your skin feel burnt from re-entry? Because I think you must have just fallen down from heaven.
Hey ladies, what's your resonance frequency?
I have E=mc squared tattooed on my ass. Wanna see?
I haven't gotten laid in 4 years, 3 months, and 12 days, plus-or-minus 2 days. Would you care to check my error bars?
Top quark or bottom quark?
My last partner wasn't very stable. She spontaneously decayed last week and left me for a neutrino.
I know the spring constant for my mattress. Wanna make some data?
Like the ideal vacuum, you're the only thing in my universe.
Heisenberg was wrong. I'm certain about what you're doing tonight.
Engineers don't know the first thing about pleasing a woman. Friction alone can't get the job done.
Why don't we measure the coefficient of static friction between me and you?
In my bed, it's perpetual motion all night long, baby.
I'm attracted to you like the Earth is attracted to the Sun - with a large force inversely proportional to the distance squared.
I wish I was your first derivative so I could lie tangent to your curves.
How can I know so many hundreds of digits of pi and not the 7 digits of your phone number?
I wish I was your second derivative so I could investigate your concavities.
I need a little help with my Calculus, can you integrate my natural log?
By looking at you I can tell you're 36-25-36, which by the way are all perfect squares.
Since distance equals velocity times time, let's let velocity or time approach infinity, because I want to go all the way with you.
I can figure out the square root of any number in less than 10 seconds. What? You don't believe me? Well, then, let's try it with your phone number.
I'm not being obtuse, but you're acute girl.
I don't know if you're in my range, but I'd sure like to take you back to my domain.
Can i explore your mean value?
I heard you're good at algebra - Could you replace my X without asking Y?
Let's take each other to the limit to see if we converge.
Your beauty cannot be spanned by a finite basis of vectors.
I wish i was your problem set, because then I'd be really hard, and you'd be doing me on the desk.
You've got more curves than a triple integral.
If you were sine x and I was cosine x, then together we would make one.
